# Simon Game

This Simon game, developed using jQuery, challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of flashing cubes. 

Each turn, a cube lights up, and players must recall and click the cubes in the correct order to continue progressing. 

The game increases in complexity as the sequence grows, testing players' memory and reaction skills.
